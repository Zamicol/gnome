gs144	4.0			Male	Male.
gs191	3.1	Bad		problem metabolizing with NSAIDs	impaired NSAID drug metabolism, which is a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding when taking any of these medications: aceclofenac, celecoxib, diclofenac, ibuprofen, indomethazine, lornoxicam, meloxicam, naproxen, piroxicam, tenoxicam and valdecoxib. You have one of these *CYP2C8*3 (rs11572080 and rs10509681) *CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853) *CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910)
rs9939609(A;A)	3.1	Bad	17.7%	obesity risk and 1.6x risk for T2D	obesity risk and 1.6x risk for T2D  This genotype produces higher levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone ghrelin, increasing your risk of obesity and type-2 diabetes by roughly 60%.
gs127	3.0			Intermediate warfarin metabolizer	Approximately 30% of people are intermediate metabolizers of the popular anticoagulant Warfarin and would probably need a decreased dosage. This due to rs1799853 or rs1057910 respectively leading to the CYP2C9*2 or CYP2C9*3 alleles. For prodrugs that require activation by CYP2C9, an alternative treatment or increased dose should be considered. See also gs126
gs215	3.0			R-L21	Y chromosome paternal ancestry positive for rs11799226(G) (L21) + tested Haplogroup R (Y-DNA) SNPs and are therefore part of the haplogroup defined by these SNPs ((R1b1b2a1a2f w/ the latest ISOGG tree) or a subhaplogroup User:Cariaso and User:Meightysix are members of this Haplogroup Y (Y-DNA)
gs227	3.0			fully heterozygous, age related tasting variation	You are heterozygous at all 3 of the SNPs which are known to influence the ability to taste bitterness. This means you are better than average at detecting bitter tastes while young, but that this ability will decrease to less than average during adulthood. As a child you will probably hate brussel sprouts, and by early adulthood will discover that olives and brussel sprouts now taste good. A 2010 study shows the change bitter sensitivity which occurs over the lifespan (from bitter sensitive to less so) is more common in people with this genoset. Children with this genotype could perceive a bitter taste at lower PROP concentrations than could heterozygous adults. The threshold for adolescents was intermediate. The 3 SNPs are rs10246939, rs1726866, rs713598 in the gene TAS2R38.
gs275	3.0	Bad		Increased risk (41.6% of white men) of Atrial Fibrilliation in one copy of both SNPs reported by 23andMe.	One copy of each of the two atrial fibrillation SNPs mentioned by 23andMe is defective. This affects the formation of the heart and gives a high risk of Atrial Fibrillation (quivering of the top part of the heart). It also seems to increase the risk of Cardioembolic ischemic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain) although 23andMe doesn't mention that. For European men, 23andMe reports this as a 41.6% risk, compared to the 27.2% average. The risk is lower for women. Based on several quality studies, and confirmed for Europeans and partly for Asians. It's recommended that you eat a heart-healthy diet, and only drink alcohol in moderation, to lower the risk. See a doctor for more information.

rs910873(A;G)	3.0	Bad	15.0%	1.7x increased risk of melanoma; increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma	1.7x increased risk of melanoma; increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma  You carry one allele associated with an increased risk for melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Watch for unusual or expanding skin growths or moles, always use SPF 30, and avoid the direct sun between 10am and 4pm. In a nested case-control study based on the Nurses Health Study, the correlation between rs910873 and skin cancer was examined in a Caucasian population. This study included 218 melanoma cases, 285 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases, 300 basal cell carcinoma (BCS) cases, and 870 age-matched controls. rs910873 was found to be significantly associated with increased risks of melanoma and SCC (but not BSC) in both additive (additive OR for melanoma, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.19&#8211;2.34; additive OR for SCC, 1.5...
rs10033464(G;T)	3.0	Bad	15.9%	1.28x increased risk of Atrial Fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke.	1.28x increased risk of Atrial Fibrillation and cardioembolic stroke.  This is one copy of a mutant version (and one of the normal version) which slightly affects the formation of the heart and makes people slightly more likely to get Atrial Fibrillation (quivering of the top chambers of the heart caused by chaotic electrical signals) and slightly more likely to have a cardioembolic stroke (blocked blood flow to the brain). But also check the other SNP nearby (rs2200733) which affects Atrial Fibrillation even more. 23andMe gave this a 4 star confidence rating as it has been heavily studied. It has been confirmed in Europeans.

rs53576(A;G)	2.8	Bad	None	lack of empathy?	lack of empathy?  You have a SNP in the oxytocin receptor which may make you less empathetic than most people. When under stress you may have more difficulty recognizing the emotional state of others which impacts loneliness, parenting, and socializing skills. Some studies have suggested that the A;G genotype is associated with an intermediate level of empathy (compared to the G;G and A;A genotypes), although most report that A;G and A;A individuals have similar levels of empathy and stress handling capabilities.
rs9272346(A;A)	2.7	Bad	33.6%	18.5x risk of Type-1 Diabetes	18.5x risk of Type-1 Diabetes  Although found in approximately 1/3rd of all people, this variation appears to significantly increase risk of Type-1 diabetes. This increases your relative risk approximately 18x, which changes your lifetime risk from a very small 0.04% to a still very small 0.75% chance. Your odds are not 75%, they are 0.75%, which is less than 1%. You should consult the Type-1 diabetes Medical Condition to see other snps that influence your risk.

gs157	2.5			more stimulated by coffee	You appear to have a common genotype in the gene CYP1A2 which metabolizes coffee more slowly than some other forms. The same amount of caffeine will tend to have more stimulating effect on slow metabolizers than on fast metabolizers. Ciprofloxacin is also metabolized by CYP1A2, but is unclear if your genotype should influence its effect.
gs161	2.5			CYP2C9 Intermediate Metabolizers	CYP2C9 intermediate metabolizers are 30% of the population. May require slightly different dosages for drugs such as tamoxifen, warfarin, fluvastin, and many nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
gs256	2.5			Blue eyes	thumb Heterozygous for what calls blue eye color haplotype #1. It seems 'blue', might be overstating it. In the eye color research community, there seems to be a distinction between the dark brown eyes typical for asian and african ancestry, and 'blue' for lighter eyes found in europeans.

When the retina cells in the eye get damaged with age, it is known as Age Related Macular Degeneration. This SNP has about three times the normal risk. This SNP wrecks the brakes on the complementary immune system, so it can become out of control, resulting in inflamation that damages the cells in the eye. The SENS Research Foundation is working on a promising cure for Age Related Macular Degeneration: http://www.sens.org/outreach/conferences/lysosens-synthetic-biology-approach-treat-age-related-macular-degeneration

Alcohol Flush: Normal, doesn't flush. Normal hangovers. Normal risk of Alcoholism. Normal risk of Esophageal Cancer. Disulfiram is effective for alcoholism.  Two working copies of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH2) mean you won't turn bright red when you drink alcohol, unlike most Asians. After your body turns alcohol into the dangerous acetaldehyde, this gene quickly turns the acetaldehyde into vinegar. It also stops the acetaldehyde in cigarettes from causing Esophageal Cancer. It reduces hangovers compared to Asians, but less hangovers and flushing obviously increases the risk of alcoholism. Alcoholism can be treated effectively with the drug Disulfiram (Antabuse) which would stop this gene from working and cause the Asian flush in non-Asians.

gs140	1.7			NAT2 slow metabolizer	Most non-Scandinavian Caucasians and approximately half of African-Americans are slow metabolizers. This variation is important because of its primary role in the deactivation of many chemicals in the body's environment, including those produced by caffeine and cigarettes as well as aromatic amine and hydrazine drugs used medicinally. In general, slow metabolizers have higher rates of certain types of cancer and are more susceptible to side effects from chemicals metabolized by NAT2. According to this source 6 snps determine NAT2 metabolism. The way their genotypes interact is very complex, which makes this one of the largest genosets in SNPedia.

rs3923809(G;G)	1.0	Good	5.3%	Normal risk of developing restless legs syndrome	Normal risk of developing restless legs syndrome  rs3923809 is a A/G variation on human chromosome 6. Associated with: Restless legs syndrome. This SNP, located in an intron of the BTBD9 gene, has a variant that is seen somewhat more frequently in individuals with restless legs syndrome. The risk allele is rs3923809(A); carriers of two such alleles, i.e. those with rs3923809(A;A) genotypes, are estimated to be 1.9 fold more likely to have restless legs syndrome than rs3923809(G;G) individuals. The authors of this study suggest that perhaps half of the cases of restless legs syndrome may involve the rs3923809 risk genotypes. Consistent with this finding, another report about rs3923809 links the (G) minor allele to a lower frequency of restless legs syndrome with an overall odds ratio of 0.5...

Of concern, EE appears to be a growing health problem with an annual incidence of at least 1 in 10,000 children (5). The primary symptoms of EE (chest and abdominal pain, dysphagia, heartburn, vomiting, and food impaction) are also observed in patients with chronic esophagitis (CE) including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (6&#8211;8). However, in contrast to GERD, EE occurs more frequently in males (80%), appears to have a common familial form, has a high rate of associated atopic disease (70%), and is typically associated with a normal pH probe recording of the esophagus (5, 9, 10) In the 3? untrans...

rs1861046(G;G)	1.0		92.9%		Conduct disorder (CD) is one of the most prevalent childhood psychiatric conditions, and is associated with a number of serious concomitant and future problems. CD symptomatology is known to have a considerable genetic component, with heritability estimates in the range of 50%. Four SNPs reached genome-wide significance with CD symptom count, based on P &lt; 5x10^-8 Two of these SNPs (rs16891867 and rs1861046) were in the gene C1QTNF7 (C1q and tumor necrosis factor-related protein 7). These SNPs were in high LD (r^2=0.97). The other top two SNPs meeting genome-wide significance were intergenic and located on chromosomes 11 and 13. Alleles A/G were found to be associated with CD symptom count or CD case status. [http://www.downstate.edu/hbnl/documents/2010-Dick-Genome-wideassociationstudyof...

rs12021720(C;T)	0.05		17.7%		a relatively common variant, which is linked to Maple Syrup Urine Disease, but appears harmless. In 1998 this paper published about a patient with MSUD who had 2 mutations 'The third patient was a compound heterozygote for a C to G transversion at nucleotide 309 in exon 4 and a G to A transition at nucleotide 1165 in exon 9, causing an Ile-to-Met substitution at amino acid 37 and a Gly-to-Ser substitution at amino acid 323.' It is that second mutation (Gly-to-Ser substitution at amino acid 323 also known as rs12021720) which was found in your data. It isn't clear from the paper if that mutation was somehow the cause of MSUD, influences its progression, or is completely harmless. In more recent years we have some additional information about this mutation, we now know it's frequency in cauc...
